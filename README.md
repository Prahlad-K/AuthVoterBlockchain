# Registration and Authentication of voters for secure voting using Azure Blockchain

The current picture of voter authentication for elections in major democracies across the world is one that faces several issues and vulnerabilities. Voter frauds such as fake IDs, duplicate votes, claims of voter database hacking, and rigging of elections are unfortunately ubiquitous news every election season. 

In India, authentication of a voter is primarily done in person, giving room to manual error and ineffective, insecure voting. 

To overcome these difficulties, our solution proposes to use Azure Blockchain to enable reliable registration and authentication of voters that uses data from several established datasets with integrated biometrics such as Aadhaar in India. 

With the usage of Blockchain for storing and processing voter data, there would be manifold improvement in security during the processes of verification and validation of voters.
